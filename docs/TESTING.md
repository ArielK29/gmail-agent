# How the Gmail agent is tested (and how to repeat it)

Last full run: **2026-10-11**, gmail-sync v10. Every line says what was run and what came out.

## 1. Unit tests (no network, seconds)
```bash
node --test supabase/functions/gmail-sync/logic.test.ts
```
**Result: 18 of 18 pass.** They cover text cleaning, charset decoding, parsing the model's answer, the retry loop (with a fake model and a fake clock: 429 then 200, 429 forever, 400), the daily budget (`planBatch`: budget left / exhausted / cut in the middle) and the Google token answer (`classifyTokenResponse`: only `400 invalid_grant` means "revoked").

## 2. End-to-end tests against the real project (`ppkbuyiatkxpfeqmvwzb`)
Force a run exactly like the scheduler does, from SQL (the secret never leaves the database), then read the answer:
```sql
select net.http_post(url := 'https://ppkbuyiatkxpfeqmvwzb.supabase.co/functions/v1/gmail-sync',
  headers := jsonb_build_object('Authorization', 'Bearer ' || (select value from public.agent_secrets where name = 'cron'), 'Content-Type', 'application/json'),
  body := '{}'::jsonb, timeout_milliseconds := 60000) as request_id;
-- then: select status_code, content from net._http_response where id = <request_id>;
```
| Scenario | How it was set up | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Normal rescan | Delete the latest summaries, reset `history_id` | Same emails saved again, position saved, `problems: []` |
| Daily budget exhausted | `gmail_usage` = 300 for today, delete 2 summaries, reset position | `saved: 0`, no error, the 2 emails stayed missing, position stayed empty (nothing lost) |
| Budget back | Remove the usage row, run again | `saved: 2`, position saved |
| Expired or revoked access (`invalid_grant`) | Throw-away auth user with a fake refresh token | Connection kept and marked `needs_reconnect`; the real member stayed `active`; the throw-away user was deleted afterwards |

## 3. Security checks
- `supabase/tests/rls_gmail_agent_test.sql` (anonymous and other members see nothing, the token column and `agent_secrets` / `gmail_usage` are closed). All blocks rolled back; results matched.
- Supabase advisors (security): only INFO "RLS enabled, no policy" on the service-role tables and the known WARNs (`pg_net` in `public`, leaked-password protection needs Pro).
- `snyk code test`: 2 MEDIUM, both in `dev-server.js` (a local helper, not deployed).

## 4. Page checks (live site, injected test rows)
Five rows including one with HTML in the sender and subject: HTML shown as plain text (no `<img>` or `<b>` created), 1 "urgent" and 1 "not urgent" badge, 2 suggested actions. Filters: urgency, category, search, no-match message, and "normal" includes unrated rows. Counter "X of Y" correct each time.

## 5. Debug loop used (what to do when something looks wrong)
1. Reproduce with section 2 (never guess).
2. Read `net._http_response` for the answer, then the logs: `query_logs` with `source = 'function_edge_logs'` and the key `response.status_code` (the key is NOT `status_code`).
3. Fix, run the unit tests, deploy both files of the function (`index.ts` and `logic.ts`).
4. Repeat the scenario and compare with the table above.

## Not verified
- A real Gemini `429` (it cannot be triggered on demand): only the fake-model test covers the retry loop.
- 30+ new emails in one run against real Gmail (the per-run limit is covered by `planBatch` tests only).
- The "Sign in with Google" flow end to end: the provider is not enabled in Supabase yet.
